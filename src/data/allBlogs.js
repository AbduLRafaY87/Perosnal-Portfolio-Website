  <p>Where we are now (2025) AI is in every field. AI is embedded in nearly every field such as healthcare, education, business, creativity, science, and entertainment which is significantly different from earlier generations due to several key advancements and shifts in how it’s built, trained, and applied. Here’s what makes modern AI different:</p>

  <h3>1. Scale of Models</h3>
  <p>Modern AI is built on large-scale neural networks trained on enormous datasets, allowing it to understand and generate human-like text, images, code, and more.</p>

  <h3>2. Generalization Ability</h3>
  <p>Unlike earlier AI, which was task-specific, today’s models can perform a wide range of tasks across different domains without needing to be retrained from scratch.</p>

  <h3>3. Multimodality</h3>
  <p>New AI systems handle multiple input types: text, images, audio, and video in a single unified model. This allows for more human-like understanding and interaction.</p>

  <h3>4. Conversational & Interactive</h3>
  <p>Modern AI is context-aware, conversational, and user-friendly. You don’t need to be a coder to interact with it—you can talk to it like you would with a human assistant.</p>

  <h3>5. Open Access & Ubiquity</h3>
  <p>AI is no longer confined to labs. It’s integrated into tools used by millions of people daily, from writing assistants and chatbots to design tools and enterprise solutions.</p>

  <h3>6. Emergent Abilities</h3>
  <p>Large models often exhibit surprising capabilities such as reasoning, summarization, and even creativity that emerge naturally from training at scale, without being explicitly programmed.</p>

  <h3>7. Ethical and Societal Awareness</h3>
  <p>As AI impacts more aspects of life, there’s growing emphasis on responsible development, including bias mitigation, transparency, and AI alignment with human values.</p>

  <p>Going back to origin “The Idea of Artificial Life” when not even the term AI was coined. Ancient Greeks imagined mechanical beings i.e Talos, a giant bronze automaton. Philosophers like Aristotle and Al-Kindi (Islamic Philosopher) developed formal logic by working on the foundation of reasoning, cryptography and mathematical reasoning. These ideas planted the seed that “thinking” can be formalized.</p>

  <p>During (1600s — 1800s) people like René Descartes proposed humans as “thinking machines.” Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz dreamed of a “universal calculus” where reasoning could be reduced to math. Charles Babbage & Ada Lovelace (1800s) created designs for the first programmable machine (the Analytical Engine). Ada even speculated it could one day “compose music,” a foreshadowing of creative AI.</p>

  <p>In the early 20th century, people like George Bool and Bertrand Russell formalized reasoning. Alan Turing in 1935 proposed a Turing machine that proves that machines could simulate any process of formal reasoning. His famous “Can Machines Think?” (1950) paper introduced the Turing Test, a benchmark for AI.</p>

  <p>The official birth of AI as a field or research discipline was in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference with pioneers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others. McCarthy coined the term “Artificial Intelligence.” In the early stages, programs solved algebra problems, checkers-playing programs, and in 1966 the first chatbot like Eliza came into existence. Optimism was high; scientists thought human-level AI was just around the corner, which was the biggest misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>In the (1970s — 1990) the reality hit. Computers were slow, memory was small, and problems were harder than expected. Funding dropped and that time is called the “AI Winter.” Still, progress continued quietly in Expert Systems in the 1980s (rule-based software for medicine, business, etc.). Backpropagation (1986) revived interest in neural networks.</p>

  <p>Fast forward to the 21st century, a combination of Big Data, powerful GPUs, and better algorithms transformed AI from a niche research area into a global force.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Key Milestones</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2000s:</strong> Machine learning began outperforming traditional rule-based systems.</li>
    <li><strong>2012:</strong> AlexNet, a deep neural network, won the ImageNet competition, signaling a breakthrough in image recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>2016:</strong> DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated world champion Lee Sedol in Go, a game once thought too complex for machines.</li>
    <li><strong>2018–2020s:</strong> Introduction of transformers like BERT and GPT revolutionized natural language processing.</li>
    <li><strong>2022 onwards:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion brought generative AI to the mainstream.</li>

        excerpt:
            "The Secret to Becoming Unstoppable",
        fullContent: `
  <p>We all have moments when life feels overwhelming, our motivation dips, and the easiest thing to do is stay in our comfort zone. It’s warm there, it’s safe, and it’s tempting to linger. But deep inside, your inner you knows you’re capable of so much more.</p>

  <p>Pushing yourself doesn’t mean running endlessly — it means stepping out of your comfort zone, recharging when you need to, and coming back more focused than ever. Sometimes pushing your limits lets you know about your strengths.</p>

  <h3>Comfort Zone: A Safe Prison</h3>
  <p>Your comfort zone feels like home, but it can also be a trap.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It stops you from growing.</li>
    <li>It keeps you from reaching your full potential.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ask yourself: Am I staying here because I’m happy, or because I’m afraid to push forward?</p>
  <p>The truth is, everything amazing lies outside the boundaries of your comfort zone. It’s where the magic happens — new opportunities, personal growth, and confidence await you there.</p>

  <h3>Be Your Own Motivation</h3>
  <p>Motivation doesn’t always come from others. It comes from you — your dreams, your willpower, and your belief in yourself. On tough days, remind yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why did I start?</li>
    <li>What’s my ultimate goal?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sometimes, you have to be your own cheerleader. Push yourself when no one else will. Tell yourself, “I’ve got this,” even when you feel like you don’t.</p>

  <h3>It’s Okay to Hit Pause and Recharge</h3>
  <p>Life isn’t a sprint — it’s a marathon. If you feel tired, uninspired, or overwhelmed, it’s okay to leave everything behind for a while. Step away. Enjoy a walk, meet friends, or spend time doing something you love.</p>
  <p>Recharge your mind. Recharge your soul.</p>
  <p>And when you come back, you’ll be more focused, more determined, and stronger than before. Sometimes, a short pause gives you the clarity to move forward with purpose.</p>

  <h3>Never Feel Low: It’s Never Too Late</h3>
  <p>We all fall behind sometimes, and that’s okay. The important thing is to remember:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s never too late to start again.</li>
    <li>Better late than never.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each day is a new chance to reset. No matter how many times you’ve stopped or stumbled, the opportunity to push yourself still exists.</p>
  <p>That voice inside you — the one that says you can — is the one you need to listen to. Trust yourself. You are stronger than you think, and every push you give yourself today will take you closer to the person you want to become.</p>
  <p>Life is all about balance. Push yourself to step out of your comfort zone, recharge when needed, and come back with focus and energy. It’s not a straight path, and that’s okay. What matters is progress, not perfection.</p>
  <p>Start now. Believe in yourself. And remember: the hardest part is taking that first step, but once you do, you’ll never look back.</p>

  <h3>Before 2025: Start Small and Stay Consistent</h3>
  <p>You don’t need to start big from day one. Start small:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>List a few tasks to begin with.</li>
    <li>Focus on accomplishing them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some tasks might not get done, and that’s okay. Stay consistent, and reward yourself for small victories. Exercise daily to keep your mind fresh and energized.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Day by day, month by month, you’ll become stronger and more capable. Be your own boss, and let your progress fuel your ambition. Don’t leave just by thinking “What will happen by doing these small tasks?” That 1% betterment in yourself every day compounds to more than you can imagine.</p>

            "Building Your Writing Skills Over Time",
        fullContent: `
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This article is for beginners who are new to article writing and thinking about publishing their very first piece. Even if you’re not a newcomer, you might still discover something useful here. If you’re feeling unsure, you’re not alone — but the journey is worth it. “Every journey begins with a single step.”</p>

  <h2>Writing</h2>
  <p>Writing an article, or any form of content, can feel challenging for many newcomers. Writing is not just a skill; it’s an art. As human beings, we often strive for perfection, and before we even begin, we’re already evaluating the quality of our work.</p>

  <p>Here’s the thing: we tend to overthink. A simple solution?</p>

  <p>Write down your thoughts in a diary or notebook. This will help you organize your ideas, which you can later refine when you begin writing.</p>

  <p>A common mistake is delaying publication in pursuit of perfection. But perfection is a myth. Experience and feedback are the real teachers. Once you publish your first article, you’ll receive valuable input from readers, helping you understand what resonates with people.</p>

  <p>Not everyone will love your first article — and that’s okay. Some will appreciate it and guide you toward improvement.</p>

  <p>But the key is taking that first step.</p>

  <h2>Building Your Writing Skills Over Time</h2>
  <p>Good article writing involves more than just ideas. It requires skills like developing a richer vocabulary, crafting attention-grabbing headlines, and making your content engaging.</p>

  <p>These are things you’ll learn as you write more.</p>

  <p>The best time to start anything in life is now. Don’t wait for the perfect moment — it doesn’t exist. Your journey as a writer begins with that first step.</p>
